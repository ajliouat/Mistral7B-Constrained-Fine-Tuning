# Mistral-7B Dynamic Adaptation Project

*Cooming soon!*

## Introduction

This project focuses on the development of a dynamic adaptation system for Mistral-7B, a lightweight version of the popular Mistral language model series. The objective is to enhance Mistral-7B’s capability to adapt its responses based on real-time triggers detected during user interactions. This approach ensures the model’s behavior aligns continuously with user expectations and predefined operational rules, particularly useful in scenarios like customer service where different user inputs might require distinct levels of urgency and specific tones of response.

## Features

- **Trigger-based Response Adaptation**: Integrate real-time detection of specific keywords or phrases, adjusting the model's tone and content of responses accordingly.
- **Priority Handling**: Automatically adjust response style and urgency for high-priority users or issues.
- **Issue Escalation**: Detect escalation triggers and modify responses to reflect the need for immediate attention.
- **Custom Behavior Rules**: Allows customization of triggers and responses according to specific business rules and user needs.
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Utilizes a streamlined version of the Mistral-7B, optimized for quick adaptations and lower resource usage.

## Usage

The project is structured to be easily integrated into existing customer service systems or any platform requiring dynamic interaction capabilities. Below is a quick start guide on setting up and running the system:

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/mistral-7b-dynamic-adapt.git
cd mistral-7b-dynamic-adapt
```

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Edit `config.json` to specify the triggers and corresponding responses. Example format:

```json
{
  "priority_client": "As a valued priority client, I will ensure your issue is resolved promptly.",
  "escalate_issue": "I understand your frustration. I will escalate this to ensure immediate attention."
}
```

### Running the Model

To start the model with dynamic behavior adaptation:

```bash
python run_model.py
```

## Development

### Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### Testing

Run the automated test suite to ensure stability across changes:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
