# Constrained Fine-Tuning for Language Models (CFT-LM)

## Coming Soon

### Overview

This project is at the forefront of deploying Constrained Fine-Tuning (CFT) to develop language models that not only adhere to rigorous, predefined behavioral guidelines but also achieve high performance and maintain a lightweight architecture. Our goal is to pioneer a framework that integrates operational constraints directly into the model's learning process, facilitating compliance and ethical alignment in automated systems.

### Objectives

Create a state-of-the-art language model tailored for environments requiring strict adherence to policy and ethical constraints, without compromising on performance and efficiency. The model is designed to deliver:
- **High Performance**: Ensuring that the model achieves industry-leading benchmarks in language comprehension and response generation.
- **Rule Adherence**: Integrating a comprehensive set of rules to guide the model’s outputs, ensuring they meet organizational and legal standards.
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Developing a model that maintains minimal computational overhead to enhance scalability and deployment flexibility across varied platforms.

### Approach

#### Constrained Fine-Tuning (CFT)

We implement a dual-objective fine-tuning process:

1. **Rule-Augmented Training**:
   - **Rule Integration**: Rules are embedded within the model’s training data, codifying expected behaviors and response patterns.
   - **Adaptive Response Mechanisms**: The model dynamically adjusts outputs based on real-time context, maintaining relevance and adherence to the embedded rules.

2. **Optimization for Performance and Efficiency**:
   - **Model Pruning and Quantization**: Techniques like pruning and quantization are employed post-training to reduce model size and computational demand, optimizing runtime performance without loss of accuracy.
   - **Distributed Computing**: Leverage distributed training techniques to enhance the training speed and incorporate more extensive and diverse datasets.

### Technologies

- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face’s Transformers
- **Model Architecture**: Based on the lightweight Mistral-7B, customized and optimized for efficient real-time processing.
- **Deployment**: Containerization with Docker, orchestrated with Kubernetes for scalable deployment across cloud platforms.
- **Monitoring**: Integration with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring of model performance and operational metrics.

### Use Case: Customer Service Automation

In a customer service context, the model provides differentiated responses based on customer status and query urgency:

- **Priority Client Detection**: Enhances response urgency and attentiveness, ensuring high-value customers receive immediate and exceptional service.
- **Issue Escalation**: Automates the detection of escalation triggers, prompting immediate supervisory intervention without manual oversight.
